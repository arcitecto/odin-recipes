    <h3>Cilantro Chicken and Rice</h3>
    <p>Chicken thighs are marinated with cilantro and lime before baking with a savory rice in this delicious one-pot
        meal.</p>

    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</h4>
    <p><em>Marinade</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated lime zest</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Chicken and Rice</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 (4 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine cilantro, olive oil, lime juice, lime zest, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper in a bowl or plastic storage container. Add chicken and coat well in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning chicken occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove chicken thighs from the marinade, rubbing garlic onto both sides of the chicken. Add chicken to the hot oil and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Turn off burner and transfer chicken to a plate; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken stock and water into the Dutch oven, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden or plastic spoon to loosen any browned bits. Stir in rice, lime juice, and salt. Place chicken on top of the rice and cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and remove chicken to a plate using tongs. Stir rice from bottom to top then place the chicken back on top of the rice.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, until all the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is soft, 15 to 18 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked chicken to a plate and stir 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro and 1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest into the rice. Fluff with a fork and serve with the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
