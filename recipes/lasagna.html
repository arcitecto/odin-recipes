    <h3>Oven Baked Lasagna</h3>

    <p>My Grammy's version of lasagna. Prepared the day before and left in the fridge overnight, it pops quickly into
        the oven and is on the table in no time. Sometimes I'll gussy it up with herbs and spices, but there is
        something nice and simple and homey about how Grammy made it. Easily halved or doubled</p>

    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (30 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounces grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><strong>Steps</strong>:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the ground beef in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, about 5
            minutes; drain fat. Stir in the marinara sauce, water, and salt. Bring to a boil. Remove sauce from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange 6 noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking if necessary to fit. Spoon 1/2 of the sauce over
            noodles. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers with remaining
            noodles, sauce, cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover tightly with foil;
            refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake lasagna, covered, until noodles are soft, cheese is melted, and sauce is bubbly, about 1 hour. Allow to
            sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pork Chops in Veracruz Sauce</h3>
    <p>Give your weeknight chops a flavor boost with some Veracruz zing! Boneless loin chops simmer in a lively combo of
        onions, tomatoes, garlic, and fresh herbs, yielding beautiful color and delicious flavor. Sauteed zucchini and
        steamed rice are excellent dinner sides for this tasty dish.</p>

    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1-inch thick) boneless pork loin chops</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic-infused olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped tomatoes with juices</li>
        <li>1/2 cup slice poblano-stuffed green olives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2 lime</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Steps</strong>:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a paper towel to pat pork chops dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until butter is melted and oil is
            shimmering. Carefully add pork chops and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat and
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onion slices to the same skillet. Saute, stirring frequently, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. Add
            garlic and stir for about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, olives, capers, jalapeno strips, bay leaves, thyme, and
            oregano. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Nestle chops into the vegetable mixture and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until no longer pink in the
            center, about 12 minutes. Place chops on a serving plate and increase heat to medium-high. Discard bay
            leaves and herb sprigs. Cook until liquid is reduced and thickened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon vegetables and sauce over chops. Garnish with cilantro. Squeeze lime juice over all. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
