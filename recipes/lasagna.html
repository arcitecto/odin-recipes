    <h3>Oven Baked Lasagna</h3>

    <p>My Grammy's version of lasagna. Prepared the day before and left in the fridge overnight, it pops quickly into
        the oven and is on the table in no time. Sometimes I'll gussy it up with herbs and spices, but there is
        something nice and simple and homey about how Grammy made it. Easily halved or doubled</p>

    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (30 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounces grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><strong>Steps</strong>:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the ground beef in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, about 5
            minutes; drain fat. Stir in the marinara sauce, water, and salt. Bring to a boil. Remove sauce from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange 6 noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking if necessary to fit. Spoon 1/2 of the sauce over
            noodles. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers with remaining
            noodles, sauce, cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover tightly with foil;
            refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake lasagna, covered, until noodles are soft, cheese is melted, and sauce is bubbly, about 1 hour. Allow to
            sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pork Chops in Veracruz Sauce</h3>
    <p>Give your weeknight chops a flavor boost with some Veracruz zing! Boneless loin chops simmer in a lively combo of
        onions, tomatoes, garlic, and fresh herbs, yielding beautiful color and delicious flavor. Sauteed zucchini and
        steamed rice are excellent dinner sides for this tasty dish.</p>

    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1-inch thick) boneless pork loin chops</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic-infused olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped tomatoes with juices</li>
        <li>1/2 cup slice poblano-stuffed green olives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2 lime</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Steps</strong>:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a paper towel to pat pork chops dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until butter is melted and oil is
            shimmering. Carefully add pork chops and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat and
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onion slices to the same skillet. Saute, stirring frequently, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. Add
            garlic and stir for about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, olives, capers, jalapeno strips, bay leaves, thyme, and
            oregano. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Nestle chops into the vegetable mixture and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until no longer pink in the
            center, about 12 minutes. Place chops on a serving plate and increase heat to medium-high. Discard bay
            leaves and herb sprigs. Cook until liquid is reduced and thickened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon vegetables and sauce over chops. Garnish with cilantro. Squeeze lime juice over all. Serve warm.</li>

    <h3>Cilantro Chicken and Rice</h3>
    <p>Chicken thighs are marinated with cilantro and lime before baking with a savory rice in this delicious one-pot
        meal.</p>

    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</h4>
    <p><em>Marinade</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated lime zest</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Chicken and Rice</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 (4 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine cilantro, olive oil, lime juice, lime zest, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper in a bowl or plastic storage container. Add chicken and coat well in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning chicken occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove chicken thighs from the marinade, rubbing garlic onto both sides of the chicken. Add chicken to the hot oil and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Turn off burner and transfer chicken to a plate; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken stock and water into the Dutch oven, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden or plastic spoon to loosen any browned bits. Stir in rice, lime juice, and salt. Place chicken on top of the rice and cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and remove chicken to a plate using tongs. Stir rice from bottom to top then place the chicken back on top of the rice.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, until all the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is soft, 15 to 18 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked chicken to a plate and stir 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro and 1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest into the rice. Fluff with a fork and serve with the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
